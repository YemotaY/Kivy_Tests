# Kivy Designer Boilerplate

This repository provides a boilerplate for developing Kivy applications and includes a Kivy Designer tool for rapid UI development. The structure is organized to support both application development and extension of the Kivy Designer itself.

## Project Structure

- `conway.py`, `floatingButton.py`, `installerTemplate.py`, `menuTemplate.py`, `simpleLabel.py`: Example or template Python scripts for Kivy applications.
- `kivy-designer/`: Main folder for the Kivy Designer tool.
  - `kivy_designer.png`: Project logo or icon.
  - `LICENSE`: License file for the project.
  - `Makefile`: Build automation file.
  - `README.md`: Documentation for the Kivy Designer.
  - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the Kivy Designer.
  - `setup.cfg`, `setup.py`: Packaging and installation configuration.
  - `designer/`: Core source code for the Kivy Designer.
    - `__main__.py`, `app.py`, `__init__.py`: Main entry points and initialization.
    - `config.ini`: Configuration file.
    - `designer.kv`: Kivy language file for UI layout.
    - `help.rst`: Help documentation.
    - `components/`, `core/`, `data/`, `tools/`, `uix/`, `utils/`: Submodules for modular functionality, UI components, utilities, and resources.
    - `__pycache__/`: Python bytecode cache (should be ignored in version control).
  - `docs/`: Documentation sources and requirements.
  - `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for the Kivy Designer.
  - `tools/`: Additional tools and scripts (e.g., `pep8checker/`).
  - `venvKivyDesigner/`: Python virtual environment for the Kivy Designer (should be ignored in version control).
- `KivyDesigner/`: Additional resources or documentation for the project.
- `venvKivy/`: Python virtual environment for general Kivy development (should be ignored in version control).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```powershell
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venvKivy
   .\venvKivy\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r kivy-designer/requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Kivy Designer:**
   ```powershell
   python kivy-designer/designer/app.py
   ```

## Notes
- The `venvKivy/` and `venvKivyDesigner/` folders are for local development and should not be committed to version control.
- The `__pycache__/` directories are automatically generated by Python and should be ignored.
